# Election_Analysis

## Overview
  The purpose of this challenge was to utilize python to process election data from a .csv file and analyze the results. In order to complete this project, the goal was to utilize for loops as well as conditional statements to create a program that would read through the csv file, count votes for each candidate (and county) and print the results. The assignment also required the results be written into a text file.
